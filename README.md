# Kidney Cancer Analysis: Integrating Clinical Factors and Transcriptomic Data

## Description

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of kidney cancers, leveraging clinical factors such as sex, age at diagnosis, and tumor stage alongside transcriptomic data. 
The analysis encompasses several key components:

1. **Distribution of Cancer Types:** A detailed examination of prevalence differences based on sex and age at diagnosis.
  
2. **Assessment of Tumor Aggressiveness:** Evaluation of tumor stages to assess the progression of kidney cancers, supported by graphical visualizations.
  
3. **Survival Analysis:** A comparative analysis of patient survival durations by cancer type, employing boxplots and statistical tests to determine the significance of results.
  
4. **Study of Deaths by Cancer Type:** Calculation of proportions of living and deceased patients, visualized through pie charts.
  
5. **Management of Missing Data:** Implementation of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) for imputing missing values.
  
6. **Transcriptomic Analysis:** Integration of RNA sequencing data to explore the relationships between clinical characteristics and gene expression, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

This project aims to enhance the understanding of kidney cancer through a multifaceted approach that combines clinical insights with cutting-edge transcriptomic analysis.
